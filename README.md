## Project Description

Created a blockchain from starter code with a web interface for logging transactions. I then made three custom classes for this project: `record` to keep track of transactions, `Block` to keep track of records and mining information, and `PyChain` to manage the blockchain itself. I then used `streamlit` to allow users to input transactions and inspect the blockchain.
